1. CS 2400 Project 5 done by Kevin Kim, Sean Abi Saab, and Hemil Bhavsar.
2. Kevin Kim implemented GraphDriver.java that contained Java code necessary to create the graph that was given in the project prompt. He also helped the group by implementing the algorithms that performed both breadth-first traversal and depth-first traversal on the given graph. Sean Abi Saab  helped the group by implementing the algorithms that performed both breadth-first traversal and depth-first traversal on the given graph. He also created the javadocs for this project.
3. For this project, we used Java interface and generic data types. We also have included both versions of graph representations (adjacency matrix and adjacency list). Furthermore, we have performs unit testing on our methods. Lastly, we have included our screencast video that briefly explains our program.
